useR2016 debriefing

All talks were recorded (not tutorials) on https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/useR-international-R-User-conference/useR2016

* Machine learning

- Erin Ledell's [[https://github.com/ledell/useR-machine-learning-tutorial][machine learning in R tutorial]].
- [[https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3][H2O]] is a distributed, open-source machine learning system, which has
  interfaces in R/Python/Java.
- [[https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost][xgboost]] Extreme Gradient Boosting.
- [[https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet][mxnet]] Deep Neural Networks.

* High performance computing

- [[https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future/][future]] package makes it easy to evaluate R code in sequence or in
.  parallel, on local computers or on clusters ([[https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future.BatchJobs][future.BatchJobs]]).

* Reproducible Research

- [[http://rcloud.social/tryit/][RCloud]] is like R markdown and iPython notebooks but more
  collaborative. If I started a lab I would set up an instance of
  RCloud for collaboration between researchers! Here is one of my
  notebooks
  https://rcloud.social/view.html?notebook=1bdc0f53621a80788aaa8044bb7c529c
- [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/archivist/index.html][archivist]] package. =archive= saves R objects to github, and [[http://r-addict.com/archivist.github/][aread]]
  reads objects from github. =restoreLibs= restores old package
  versions, which may be necessary for interpreting the archived
  objects (e.g. printing an archived ggplot).
- [[https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown][bookdown]] is a new R package and [[https://bookdown.org/][publishing platform]] for reproducible
  manuals.
- I presented a [[https://github.com/tdhock/works-poster][poster]] about replacing =library(ggplot2)= with
#+BEGIN_SRC R
works_with_R("2.14.1", ggplot2="1.0")
#+END_SRC

* Data manipulation

- The dev version of data.table has [[https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/blob/master/R/fwrite.R%20][fwrite]] which is like =write.csv=
  but much faster (apparently even faster than [[https://github.com/wesm/feather][feather]]).

* Interactive graphics

- [[http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/gadgets.html][shinygadgets]] return values chosen interactively, like =identify= but
  very customizable.
- [[https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/][shinydashboard]] requires shiny.
- [[http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/][flexdashboard]] does not.
- I presented a tutorial with Claus Thorn Ekstrom about "[[https://github.com/tdhock/interactive-tutorial][Understanding and creating interactive graphics]]"
